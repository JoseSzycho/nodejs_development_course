# Performance Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Summary

In this report analysis of the next three sorting algorithms will be presented:
- Bubble Sort 
- Merge Sort 
- Quick Sort 

The final objective is to achieve the following results:
- Execution time of each sorting algorithm for different array types and different array lengths.
- Array length at which Quick Sort and Merge Sort start to outperform Bubble Sort consistently
- Why quick sort is faster than merge sort

## Methodology

To achieve the objective a code in JavaScript has been made, please check [this file](./main.js)
